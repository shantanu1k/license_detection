# license_detection

 **Basic idea**
 
   * Instead of doing letter by letter comparison, I am doing comparison 
 between words.



  **Things yet to be worked on:**
  
   
   * Different bullet points

   * Ignore Code Comment Indicators

   * Extraneous Text At the End of a License

   * Handling multiple licenses in same file
