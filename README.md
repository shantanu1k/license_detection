# license_detection

 **Approach**
 
   * Instead of doing letter by letter comparison, I am doing comparison between words.
 
   * Ignore the bullet points, copyright notice

   * Ignore the replacable text like organization name and others


  **Things yet to be worked on:**

   * Extraneous Text At the End of a License

   * Handling multiple licenses in same file
