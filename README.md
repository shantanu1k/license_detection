# license_detection

**There are lots of commits in this repo. Because, I have habit of commiting and pushing every time I make even a small changeðŸ˜…**

 **Approach**
 
   * Instead of doing letter by letter comparison, I am doing comparison between words.
  
   * Created separate class for every original license instead putting them in one **BULKY** class
     (which is in custom format)
